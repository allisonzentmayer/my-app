We would like to learn more about your coding style by having you do a small project that we will go over during your onsite visit. The task serves two purposes. The first is to test your ability to write readable and reusable javascript. The second is to give you an idea of what web development is like at Transcriptic: we need to be able to come up with solutions to domain specific problems in the life sciences.

We have provided you with a large dataset generated by a qPCR machine. It came from running a 384 well plate through 40 cycles. The dataset is a hash that maps the well ID to the fluorescence readings for each of the 40 cycles that the well went through. That's 384 wells over 40 cycles, which comes out to 15,360 readings. Your task is to build a UI that displays this data.

You will also find included a screen shot of an example qPCR UI which shows the features we would like you to build. This is not a test about how pixel perfect you can match the screenshot, so do not worry about getting it exactly right. The UI consists of a grid of 384 wells (the plate) that the user can select. Feel free to implement selection as you wish, but at a minimum you should be able to select/unselect all wells at once. The selected wells are shown in a detail table which displays the Ct value ("threshold cycle") for each well. The Ct is computed relative to a threshold value, which for this exercise is 104. The threshold cycle for a well is the cycle at which the fluorescence reading has exceeded the threshold value (see wiki page below). Each well should be colored based on its Ct value by calculating a gradient of all Ct values.

Feel free to use any technologies that you are comfortable with. Please do not take more than 5 hours on this project. Most importantly, we want to see quality over quantity.
